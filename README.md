# sunnyside-agency-landing-page

This Sunnyside agency landing page was a challenge from frontendmentor.io. No frameworks was used.

Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Css custom properties
- Flexbox
- Css animations
- Desktop-first workflow

This project made me learn a big lesson to always use a mobile-first workflow cos adding the media queries was kind of a nightmare for me. Lessons learnt anyway.
